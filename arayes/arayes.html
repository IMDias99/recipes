    <p>Arayes (Lebanese crispy meat stuffed pitas) are a delicious marriage of spicy, aromatic meat filling with golden, crisp pan-fried pita. A tahini yogurt sauce is served alongside.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong> lamb, beef or turkey</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong> Fresh herbs</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong> This homemade arayes is seasoned with paprika, cumin, coriander.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread</strong> 2 pita breads</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat</strong> Add meat to a bowl and sprinkle with parsley, minced garlic, onion, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, allspice, 1 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Use a fork or your hands to mix everything evenly. Cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li><strong> Sauce</strong> For the sauce, add tahini, lemon juice, and water to a microwave-safe bowl and cook on High until very hot, about 30 seconds. Add to a bowl with yogurt, grated garlic, pinch cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whisk until smooth and light. Chill until needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Pita</strong> Cut each pita in half and carefully open up without tearing the edges. Pitas can be warmed in a dry pan to soften them, which can make opening easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble</strong>Divide meat into 4 equal portions, and transfer into each pita half. Press and squeeze pita gently to distribute meat in an even layer that comes all the way to the cut side.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat. Place pitas in the pan, cut side up, and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining pitas.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1> Cook`s note</h1>
    <p>Since there is not a lot of filling, it is very aggressively seasoned. All spice measurements are “to taste” and should be adjusted as desired. A small amount of filling can be cooked and tested to make sure.</p>
